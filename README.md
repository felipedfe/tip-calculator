## •Description
A challenge from the Frontend Mentor website (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/tip-calculator-app-ugJNGbJUX). The objective was to create an application for calculating tips. The user enters the amount of the bill, selects the percentage of the tip using the buttons or typing in an input field and then inserts the number of people who will share the bill. The application then shows the amount to be paid for each person.

## •Challenges
It was the first application I made using styled components and it took me a while to get used to it. Even knowing CSS properties, the way we access and share them with other elements is quite different from working with css files. I believe I will practice with styled components again to improve myself!

## •Technologies and Libraries
- TypeScript
- HTML
- CSS
- React
- Styled Components

## •How to run the application
- Clone the repository on your machine
- In the terminal, install the application's dependencies: `npm install`
- Now just put the application to run!: `npm start`
